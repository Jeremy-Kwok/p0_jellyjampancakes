OurStory: Collaborative Storytelling

*under construction

Scenario One: Your team has been contracted to create a collaborative storytelling game/website.

    -Users will have to register to use the site.
    -Logged-in users can either start a new story or add to an existing story.
    -When adding to a story,
        -Users are shown only the latest update to the story, not the whole thing.
        -A user can then add some amount of text to the story.
    -Once a user has added to a story, they cannot add to it again.
    -When creating a new story,
        -Users get to start with any amount of text and give the story a title.
        -Logged in users will be able to read any story they have contributed to on their homepage (the landing page after login).
